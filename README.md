# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
In this project, I have developed a deep learning model to achieve a near state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST handwritten dataset. I have enhanced the model accuracy from 46% to 92% by feature scaling and boosted it further to 97% by using a hidden layer in the simple neural network.
